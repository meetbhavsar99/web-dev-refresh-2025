      <p>
        The <b>lion</b> (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">Panthera</a> native to
        Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded
        head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is
        sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
        prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
        lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
        Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large
        ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some
        lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt
        humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on
        humans.

        The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually
        more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to
        being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the
        lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Western
        Asia and northern parts of India, but it has been reduced to fragmented
        populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.
        It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
        populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the
        early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected
        areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
        habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for
        concern.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin
          leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient
          Greek λέων léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related.<sup
            ><a href="somesource.com">[4]</a></sup
          >
          The generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word
          'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[5]
        </p>

      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>
        Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who
        described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.[3] The genus name
        Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[10] Between the mid-18th and
        mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as
        subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.[1] They were
        distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and
        skins.[11]
